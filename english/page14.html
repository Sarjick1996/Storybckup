Dream Love 1

</small>

  <p>


My name is Reshma Akhtar. Age 48. My husband is abroad. Here I have a family with my elder son, his wife, younger son and only daughter. I married my elder son a year ago and brought him home. Everything was going well. But for the past three-four months, I have been facing a problem with my younger son. I have noticed a change in his behavior.

Getting back
His way of talking, his way of looking has become more romantic. Earlier, he never stayed at home naked. He would even wear a sando shirt on his body. But lately, he has always been naked at home. Initially, I did not pay much attention to the issues. But at one point, I started feeling annoyed. But I could not say anything verbally. I would express my annoyance in a rude manner. But he did not give up at all.

new bangla
As this went on, I started liking the matter at one point. Since my husband was not around, I was also hungry inside. And seeing her hairy, well-shaped chest, I also started to feel attracted to her a lot. But it was not easy for me to express this love as a mother. Even if the house was empty, there was one thing. But it is not easy to find an empty house in a joint family.

Even if the elder son was in the office and the daughter was in college, the grandmother would stay at home 24 hours a day. So I could not make it convenient. Finally, at one point, I broke the barrier of shame and tried to bring a loveliness to my behavior so that she would understand my consent.
She seemed quite happy to receive a response from me. But neither of us could talk about this. new bangla

Even normal conversations were becoming difficult. We would only talk in a casual manner. I liked the most when she came out of the bathroom wrapped in just a towel after taking a bath. And when I came out of the bathroom after taking a bath and fixing my untidy saree blouse, she would also look at me with fascinated eyes.

The relationship reached such a point that the normal relationship between mother and son was no longer possible. My insides were burning and burning with desire. I spent the whole day restless and silently soaked the pillow with tears all night. I stayed alone in my room and he made a bed on the floor of the drawing room. At nightfall, I would run from my room to the drawing room to see his sleeping, masculine body. new bangla

The body looked even more charming in the soft light of the dim light. My chest would heave. I would hold my chest with both hands to soothe my emotions.
As soon as I couldn't sleep at night, I no longer had any interest in eating and drinking. Which started to affect my appearance and health. Everyone in the family became worried.

Even my husband got the news. I just laughed it off and said, "It's nothing. I'm just getting old." But deep down, I understood that something had to be done soon. I couldn't live like this. One morning, I made a firm promise that as soon as he returned from the university today, I would take the opportunity to say something about this. At least I would have to call him to the roof and express my thoughts. new bangla

Otherwise, there is a high possibility that I would die by keeping everything inside my chest. Before it was time for him to return from the university, I sat down and got ready. As soon as the calling bell rang, I ran and opened the door. But as soon as I faced him, I could not look at him in shame. And he also walked past me without further ado and went inside. I wanted to die of despair.

I went to my room, locked the door, and started crying profusely on the bed. I did not even realize when I fell asleep while crying. When I woke up, I ran to the drawing room. He was deep in sleep after taking a bath and eating. Seeing his naked body, wearing a lungi, my chest was trembling. I wanted to run to him right then and there, jump on his chest and unbutton my blouse. new bangla

But this is just a guess. At home, my grandmother and daughter were sleeping in their respective rooms. Besides, even if no one was there, I couldn't lighten my personality like this. I controlled myself and went back to my room. I started waiting for her to wake up. After a while, I went back to the drawing room and saw her waking up and reading a newspaper. I stood in front of her and said, "Listen, Ayan."

She looked up from the newspaper in surprise and looked at me in surprise, what? I couldn't find any other words to say. I said softly, "No, nothing. I'll talk to you later." Saying this, I ran away from there somehow.

Now let's come to our personal description. Even though I am 48, it is not possible to guess it at all by looking at me. new bangla

Everyone thinks I am around 40. 5 feet 2 inches tall. Light brown complexion. Slightly heavy health. A little fat. I usually wear a saree at home. I don't go to the trouble of keeping a bra and panties on my body inside the house. And she is 22. Height 5 feet 8 inches. Even though I don't go to the gym, I have a well-built body of medium weight due to regular exercise at home. Short hair on my head, a light beard on my cheeks.

The two brown circles on either side of the chest full of light fur make the whole chest look dreamy. It would be wrong to say that I have sexual desire for him. Rather, love is more than sex. Since adolescence, I had a lover's mind, but after marriage, I got nothing but sex from my husband. This is the main reason why I was attracted to my son, that I saw a lover's mind in him. new bangla

Moreover, the educated, beautiful, healthy man I had dreamed of all my life, nothing of it was in my husband. But everything of it was in my son. So, forgetting all the barriers of society and reform, I wanted to float with the current.
I was tired. I understood that nothing would happen from inside the house. I had to make an excuse to go out with him.

Seeing my physical illness, the elder son had told me several times to go to the doctor, but I did not listen. But I thought that I could take my son out with this excuse. Although usually the elder son takes me to the doctor. But taking the younger son on the pretext of his busy schedule would not be inappropriate. new bangla

When the elder son Chayan told the younger son Ayan that he would have to go to the doctor with his mother tomorrow evening, the expression on Ayan's face was worth seeing. And only Antaryamiya knows my state of mind. I could not sleep all night due to restlessness. I woke up in the morning and lay in bed. My grandmother was doing all the housework alone. I closed the door of the room and remained like myself the whole day.

Finally, when that moment approached, the heaviness in my chest increased, and my face turned pale. Everyone thought that this was happening because of my illness. When the door opened and we were both leaving together, my hands, legs, whole body, whole heart were shaking. He was going first and I was behind. So he didn't notice it. When we finally got on the road and got into the rickshaw, the feeling of sitting side by side was indescribable. new bangla

I told the rickshaw driver, brother, open the rickshaw's hood. I felt cold. If the hood is open, I will need air. When the rickshaw driver opened the hood, we came closer. And when the rickshaw started moving, it felt like we were both floating in the air. I felt like I was ready to go to hell. I couldn't hold back my emotions anymore.

I gently touched one of his hands. He looked at my face and said, what happened? I couldn't say anything else in my emotions, so I put my head on his neck and started crying. He stayed silent for a while and hugged my waist with his right hand and touched my hand with his other hand and said softly, I am always with you. I wanted to die of happiness. new bangla

Only God was witnessing this union of our mother and son in the rickshaw moving on the dark road. We got down in front of a restaurant. Sitting on chairs facing each other, I could not look at him. I kept my face down. And he also started looking around for no reason. To normalize the situation, I asked, how did you start? Why and how did you get attracted to me.

He said, I suddenly found a mother and son's chatter on Facebook. After reading it, it seemed different. Later, by searching on the net about this topic, I found a treasure trove of chatters. This happened while reading them. I said, well, then I will also search and see how it feels to read them. Ayan said, but how will our new relationship progress? I said, can such a relationship progress? new bangla

He said, why not? In chatter, I see that such relationships lead to marriage and even children. Hearing this, my heart fluttered. I suppressed that thought and said, those stories are not possible in reality. It was a thing in Western countries but it is never possible in this country.
Ayan said, but love can be continued. I said, how can that be?

The house is never empty. He said, what do you need at home? If you want, I can take you to the hotel right now. Hearing this, I lowered my face in shame. I said softly, that is never possible. If someone I know somehow sees it, there will be no excuse for mother and son to go to the hotel together. Whatever happens, it will be inside the house. Never outside. He said, but how will it be possible at home? new bangla

I said, it will be possible if Bouma goes to her father's house. While Chayan is in the office and Anu is in college. We will have to wait until then. Ayan sighed and said, how will that be possible? I won't be able to control myself. Can you just stay without doing anything after understanding like this? I said in a pitiful voice, you have to be able to.

And please don't try to talk to me with gestures inside the house. If someone somehow catches or understands the matter, it's unimaginable what will happen. He was surprised and said, what is that? I can't even talk with gestures! Then how will I survive? I said, we will meet on the roof every day. You exercise on the roof every morning. new bangla

At that time, we could meet in solitude under the pretext of watering the roof plants. He smiled softly and said, "Beautiful idea." Then this is how we will meet and talk every day. While leaving the restaurant, I had my head on his shoulder the entire way in the rickshaw. And his naughty hands sometimes on my waist, sometimes on my arm, sometimes through the gap of the sari and started playing on the blouse.

It's not that there weren't some kisses and licks. I felt much calmer when I returned home. I finally got rid of the restlessness that had been going on for the past few days.
