My polite wife part 1 (housewife fucking story)

</small>

<p>

Dear readers, this is my first story. I am writing my whole truth in this article. This is not a made-up story. Although the story is unbelievable, I am telling the truth. I am Hasan. I work a small job. Due to my job, I live in Dhaka. I have to stay in Dhaka 330 days a year. My wife is Munni. She is studying in her 3rd year of honors at a university in Rajshahi. After marriage, she used to study and write from the mess like her and I used to come to Dhaka. When I went on vacation, Munni also came. It was convenient that both of our houses were in Bogra. We got married 11 months ago. In a word, Munni is a complete sex bomb. Fair skin, very little fat on her stomach and 36 size breasts hanging from her chest. She attracts me a lot.

I fucked Munni a few times after taking a medicine on the night of the wedding. Because even though my penis size is fine, I can't hold it for long due to excessive handjobs. So after fucking for several days, I realized that Munni was not satisfied with it and wanted it for a long time and deeper. And Munni's behavior also revealed that she seemed to have fucked someone before. I was not sure because I was so excited by stripping Munni naked on the night of the wedding that I didn't know if I tore her veil or not and she asked me to turn off the lights before taking off her clothes on the night of the wedding.

After fucking Munni occasionally, I would say.
Me: The inside of your vagina is still hot. If only I could fuck her one more time.

Munni: What do you mean by these words? You don't know how to do it well. For how long can I not taste the hot semen entering the depths of my vagina? Do you know how much pain I feel?

After hearing this, my suspicions increased because I had never put my money inside her pussy. Even if I did, I was wearing a condom.

Me: I haven't put my money inside your pussy in these 3 months. And even if I did, I put a condom on and then put it on.

The look on her face was indescribable. She was very nervous and thought for a moment before saying,

Munni: Oh, I liked it when you put a condom on. That's why I said it. You're looking at me with suspicion, Hasan.

Me: What's the matter with suspicion? I thought you were wearing a condom, so how did you know?

Anyway, that day it didn't happen again. But as if that thought was weighing on my mind, I noticed Munni's mischievous nature again. So a few days later my vacation ended. Munni would also go to her hostel, so I would drop her off in Rajshahi and I would go to Dhaka, so we would both travel together. In the meantime, she had squeezed my big breasts many times in the bus. And before saying goodbye to her, she whispered in my ear, "Don't touch my vagina this time." I looked at the side of the road and saw that there were not many people. Then I took my right hand and moved my vagina once with my middle finger. At the same time, Munni closed her eyes and it seemed as if she had become senseless. Then I removed my hand and said to her,

I: Let's take you to the hostel.

Munni: No, no, you don't have to go. You have to go far, go. It will be a long night for you to go. You have come this far for me, working hard, how far will you go? So you don't have to go, I can go alone.

I am thinking to myself, how much my wife thinks about me. Thinking about this, I bid her farewell there and left.

That day was Friday. I was lying in bed watching a video in the evening when suddenly a text came on Messenger. "How are you, brother? I'm Jerin.

Jerin is Munni's younger sister from the university who lives in the same hostel. She came to our wedding.

Me: Yes, sister, I'm fine. How are you?

Jerin: Good brother. Look, today we have a picnic in our hostel, but Munni sister is not there.

Me: (a little surprised) No, you mean?

Jerin: Why don't you know, brother? Sister stays at her uncle's house 3-4 days a week. And every Friday she is permanent.

A distant relative of Munni's uncle lives in Rajshahi. But he never told me that he goes there. He went there today too but didn't tell me once. My interest increased a little.

Me: Well, sister, when will he return?

Jerin: Sometimes the next morning or before noon. Why didn't sister tell you, brother?

Me: No Apu might have forgotten to say.

Jerin: Maybe brother.

I couldn't take it anymore and I wondered if Munni really goes to her uncle's house? I was very curious to know. Since Jerin said that she goes to her permanent residence every Friday, I decided to see where she goes. We have many friends in Rajshahi. I took 3 days off from work and left on Wednesday night. That night, I got the address of their hostel from a friend from Jerin and told Jerin not to tell Munni anything and to text me when Munni comes out. I don't know what she thought, but she assured me that she wouldn't tell Munni anything.

In the afternoon, I took my friend's bike and went to the hostel. I had a mask on my face and sunglasses so that Munni wouldn't recognize me if she suddenly saw me. There are many shops in front of the hostel. I am sitting in one of them, drinking tea and cigarettes, waiting for Munni to come down. After about two hours, Jerin sent me a message, "Brother, apu just came out." It happened. As soon as I sent the message, a white private car stopped in front of the hostel. I put on a mask and sunglasses. After a while, Munni came and got into the car. There was a boy my age in the car. I also started the bike and started going behind. After about 5 minutes, the car entered a two-story house. I left the bike on one side of the road and locked it. After that, I took out my phone and called Munni. She answered the phone.

Me: How are you? What are you doing?

Munni: She replied in an annoying voice. I have an exam the day after tomorrow and am studying. Don't disturb me. I won't be able to talk anymore today. We will talk tomorrow. Saying this, she hung up.

Now I was sure that this was not Munni's uncle's house. I thought I had to go inside. The house was surrounded by walls on all sides. It was on the road, but the front of the house was It was a jungle-like hut. So I entered the house from the back. The house was deserted. Since it had glass windows, I looked from the outside to see if anyone was inside. The tension increased again when I saw the main door closed. My mood got bad. Suddenly, I looked to the right of the house and saw a small staircase to go to the roof. I climbed up to the roof using it and saw the roof door open. Now I was afraid that who knows how many people were in the house. Anyway, I entered very cautiously. There were four rooms on two floors. I was wondering if they were downstairs or upstairs. As I was thinking about this, I heard Munni saying: Anik, give me the towel.
I understood which room they were upstairs in.

Anik said, wait, I'm coming. We'll take a bath together.
Hearing that, I felt something. What?? Someone else will take a bath with my wife.

Munni told me that she had a friend named Anik who wanted to have a relationship with her. But Munni ignored him. So is this the same Anik?‚Äù

I wanted to see what was going on. After a while, Anik probably entered the bathroom and at this opportunity, I entered the room as the door was open. I entered. Munni's Khimar burqa was placed on the bed. Opposite the bed was a big sofa. Since there was a sofa after the bed and a wall after the sofa, I decided to hide behind the sofa. So I did. I hid. After a while, the two of them came out laughing at what they had said.

Munni: Why is this boy going crazy about this? He has been up all night.

Anik: What's the matter? Last Friday, you said that you would do whatever you want today. That day, nothing was done for menstruation except drinking milk. So why not do something crazy today?

Munni: Uffff, okay, go do whatever you want, I won't stop you at all. But today you have to suck my pussy for a long time.

Anik: I won't just suck it. Shire I will definitely throw it away.

As I said this, I pushed Munni onto the bed and threw her away. As soon as I removed the towel from her chest, she became completely naked. Munni then made a scared face and said to Anik, "Please Anik, don't hold me. Look at my nipples, don't put your lips on them at all."

Hearing this, Anik immediately held both of Munni's hands on the bed and took the right nipple in his mouth and started sucking it.

Munni: Uffffff Anininininininik, what are you doing, ahhhhhhhhhhhh. Leave it, I say. These are only my husband's.

Anik: Don't think of me as your husband today, see how much pleasure I will give you.

Munni: No, no, no. You sucked the nipple, it's okay. But don't put your lips on my pussy, but with your tongue, I will mess up the pussy, I told you not to.

Munni seemed to be gesturing to Anik to suck his cock.

Anik left his nipples and came to his feet, spread his legs wide and immediately slid his tongue inside his cock. Munni bent over and said with her mouth, "Ss Anik: I fucked you before marriage, so why are you making so much drama, Magi? Do you want a higher rate? If I had torn your veil, I would have given you 1 lakh taka. Who tore your veil?

I became a fool after hearing this. That means Munni has been fucking me since before marriage. And that too for money.

Munni: The day you proposed to me to go into a relationship. That day I understood that you wanted to eat me. I understood before too. But I didn't do what you did. Then when you sent me a picture of your penis on messenger. After seeing that, I decided to put you in my vagina. And I will talk about tearing the veil another day.

Anik: Don't tell Magi who tore it. If you tell me, I will increase it to 5 thousand.

Munni: Well, listen, since I got admitted to the university, our Bengali teacher Hadi Sir used to look at me differently. I could understand that the man's wife had died. Rani is my best friend. Rani has had sex with Hadi a few times. Later, Rani shared everything with me. When she also said that Sir gives a lot of pleasure to fuck. Hearing this, I felt a thrill in my pussy. Before this, I had seen him fucking on my mobile phone and I had poured my own pussy with my hand. But after hearing what Rani said, my interest in Hadi Sir increased. Then one day, when I met Sir, I asked him how he was doing, did you eat? Sir then looked sad and said,

Sir: No more eating. Since my wife is gone, there is no one to look after me. I can't even cook properly. So I eat whatever I get at the hotel.

Sir, I felt sorry after hearing one thing. I thought how much the man is in trouble.

Munni: Now, sir, will you eat at the hotel at noon and at night too?

Sir: (with a serious face) Yes, besides, there is no way, I can't eat my own food.

Munni: Sir, you don't have to eat out at night. I will go to your house this afternoon and cook for you.

Sir: Why are you going to bother unnecessarily, Munni?

Munni: No problem, sir. It doesn't matter.

With this, I went to Sir's house in the afternoon with the address of Sir's house. Sir's house was a flat on the third floor of a five-storey building. It had one bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom and a guest room. Sir opened the door and was very happy to see me when I rang the bell. I started working as soon as I entered the house and Sir told me that I was going to take a shower. The weather is bad, call me if it rains. I let my clothes dry on the roof. Saying this, Sir entered the bathroom. After a while, it started raining. I told Sir. Sir was already soaking wet. So he told me that there was a blue shirt and white pants to bring. I also went to the roof. The roof was big and the clothes were spread on one side. So I got wet to get them. When I got to the room, I saw Sir said as he saw me coming out.

Sir: Are you wet?

Saying this, he brought a towel and said, "Please wear this." After my wife died, I left all her clothes at home. So I can't give you anything else except this."

Munni: No, sir, it's okay, it will dry up in a while.

Who listens to whom? Sir started insisting. I went to the bathroom and took off everything and wrapped the towel over my wet bra and panties because if I didn't wear a bra, my breasts would have been clearly visible. As soon as I came out of the bathroom, I saw Sir looking at me with a smile. Why not? The black bra strap coming down from the neck made my fair chest even more beautiful and my hairless legs were visible up to the knees. Sir suddenly said, "Why didn't you open it? It's also wet. It will get cold." I said, "I won't stay long, sir, I will cook and leave." Sir told me, "You saw how much it is raining outside, how will it go now?"

It was around 6:30 pm then. I told Sir that I will see if the rain stops in a while. Sir said that I will see later, you should take it off. No, it will be cold. I said no. This time Sir came to me and said that this girl is not listening to me, so he grabbed the towel and pulled it. And immediately it fell to the ground. Now I am standing wearing only my bra and panties.

Sir didn't waste any time and said let me see where the hook is and he hugged me to his chest and with one pull he put his hand on my back and unhooked the hook and separated the bra from my chest. Then I held my breasts with my hand and told Sir what are you doing sir I am doing it. Sir saw the part on the breasts and said that it is still wet so he lifted the towel and moved my hand and took the towel in both hands and started wiping the breasts. Uffffff I felt so good then I had no intention of stopping him Harami said come to the room and took my hand and took me to the room I was standing with my head down. Sir said if you don't wipe these you might get cold you have come to my house I have no responsibility alone.

Now he lifted my hand and wiped my armpits. What he did next was beyond my imagination. Sir opened my panties in one go. This time I didn't do it (reluctantly). Sir didn't listen to anything. While standing, he spread his legs a little and then pressed the towel in the middle of my vagina. And as soon as his hand started rubbing up and down, I couldn't stop it anymore. I said with my mouth, "Iss Now I moved my hand away and said, "It's been a long time, sir. No more." As soon as I said that, the electricity went out, maybe there was a storm outside. The room was completely dark. Sir said, "This is it, now I won't be able to see you anymore." I didn't say anything. A little later, I felt my pussy being rubbed with my finger. I was feeling very happy. I was also making a soft moan in happiness. Sir must have heard this. Then, it was as if Sir had become a beast. In the darkness, I realized that Sir was lying on my chest. After a few seconds, before I knew anything, his penis plunged into my pussy in one thrust. I started screaming in extreme pain. And I said, "I'm dying, sir, what did you do?"

Then Sir squeezed my breasts very tightly and took both his lips with him. Meanwhile, he was squeezing me as much as he wanted, I couldn't scream or stop myself. I had never felt so much pain before. But surprisingly, after a while, I noticed that I was slowly feeling pleasure in my vagina. After a while, I had never felt such pleasure in my heart before. Then slowly, I hugged Sir on his back with my hands and cum was coming out of my mouth, yess Munni: I have never done it before, but I have fingered it. And you are the man who stole my chastity veil.

This is the story of my veil being torn. Do you understand my darling?

Anik: How far did this incident go?

Munni: It has been a long time, Babu. I will tell you the rest another day. Oh my, look at what the boy has done to my vagina by fucking it. Why do you say you are such a good fucker? I want to fuck you every night to satisfy my cravings.

Anik: If you want, I can fuck you every day. But then I will get your payment at the end of the month, not before that.

Munni: How?
