Neetu took off her bra herself.

</small>

<p>


What happened to you?? How many times did I call you last night, you didn't pick up??'
'Damn! Don't tell me again! That sir who was finishing his assignment didn't have any news of the world'
'Why are you studying so much? Give some time to the world. Otherwise, the world won't give you time later'
'You said it too. Come on, let's go to class, it's getting late'
When he went to class, he saw that the same sir who had made it difficult for him to sleep at night had not come today.
'Oh, father! Sir, Shihab didn't come. What should I do now??'
'I see, sir, he's not here. Let's go and sit in the library'
The two of them started talking and climbing the fifth floor. Nitu quickly pulled Shihab closer. Then he brought his lips down to Shihab's lips in a kiss. He kissed Shihab deeply. He said, "This time tell me how many spoons I will give you." Shihab tried to control himself and said, "Your lips are sweet enough even if you don't give me sugar." "Good boy." Neetu turned back to Shihab and started making coffee. Shihab looked at Neetu. Neetu's ass was quite full. Very sexy. Her open hair on top of it was pulling Shihab like a magnet. Shihab couldn't stop himself anymore. He hugged Neetu from behind. He buried his face in Neetu's neck. He filled Neetu's neck with kisses and love bites. Both hands went to Neetu's waist. As the kiss increased, both hands started moving up to Neetu's breasts. Neetu's feather-soft breasts slowly started getting hard under Shihab's touch. At the same time, Shihab's penis started getting hard. Neetu She turned and faced Shihab. Shihab immediately brought his lips down to Neetu's lips. As she sucked Neetu's lips, Shihab brought Neetu's tongue to his mouth. Then he started caressing it with the gentle pressure of his lips. While kissing, he put his hand between Neetu's top. Shihab made Neetu restless with the kiss and the pressure of his hand on her breast. This time Shihab took off Neetu's top. Seeing Neetu in her blue bra, Shihab felt like he was seeing a heavenly bride. He picked Neetu up in his arms and brought her to the bedroom. After making Neetu lie down on the bed, he jumped on her again. He started filling Neetu's breasts with small kisses right on top of the bra. He gave a small bite on the nipple of her left breast. And started pressing another breast with his left hand. Neetu was getting excited momentarily by Shihab's caresses. After a while, he Her body was twisting like a snake. Shihab lowered his face to Neetu's stomach. While kissing, he came to the ribbon of the skirt. Then he lowered the skirt with his tan. Neetu was also wearing matching blue panties. Shihab this time looked at Neetu's navel. First, he kissed in a circle around the navel. Then he lowered his tongue to the navel. As if Shihab wanted to know the depth of Neetu's navel with his tongue today. Neetu could not take so much teasing. Raising her body a little, Neetu let out a cry of pleasure and completed her first orgasm. Then she pulled Shihab to her chest. Once again, Neetu's lips found refuge in Shihab's lips. While kissing, Neetu took off Shihab's shirt and sat on him. Neetu took off her own bra. Now Neetu's naked breasts were in front of Shihab's eyes. Tight medium-sized breasts were pink in color. Nipple. Nitu came down to kiss Shihab's neck and chest. After that, without wasting any time, she took off her jeans and underwear and exposed Shihab's swollen penis. There was some lust on its tip. Nitu licked it with the tip of her tongue. Then she took it inside her mouth and started sucking the penis. Shihab started going crazy when Nitu's soft lips touched his penis. And Nitu also started sucking the penis like a lollipop. Shihab could not stay any longer and made Nitu lie down on the bed again. He took off her panties at once. Clean saved pussy. Shihab did not delay any longer. He brought his face down to Nitu's pussy. He started moving Nitu's aroused clit with his tongue. Occasionally, a light bite. As soon as Shihab sucked, he inserted his finger into Nitu's pussy. Tongue in clit With this, he started to play with his fingers in Nitu's vagina.
'Shihab, how much more will you play with me! I can't do it anymore. My whole body is on fire. Please put out the fire'

Shihab got up from his vagina after hearing Nitu's words. His penis also felt like it was about to burst. He placed his penis in Nitu's vagina and slowly pushed it in half. Nitu let out a moan of pleasure again. Shihab slowly inserted his entire penis into Nitu's vagina. Nitu's vagina was quite tight and warm. This condition of Nitu's vagina made Shihab even hotter. He started to pound Nitu even harder. At this point, Nitu was also at the peak of excitement
'A little harder, Shihab. Come in a little more. Hmm like this. Aah.'
'Shihab, don't stop. I'll have it now.'
As he said Neetu completed her orgasm again. Shihab could not hold it in for much longer. After thrusting for a while, he filled Neetu's pussy with his semen.
'Sir, we finished our assignment with a lot of fun, so what, Shihab!!"
'So!! Let's complete the second part of the assignment too'
Say this and Shihab jumped on Neetu again.
