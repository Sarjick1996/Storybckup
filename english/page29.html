Aunty's illegal sex (Bhabi's illigal sex)

</small>

<p>


The ceremony of initiation into prostitution is a ritual
I am Nivedita, I am about 43 years old, but when you look at me, I look younger than 35, because I exercise regularly and still maintain a beautiful body shape. My figure is 34, 28, 36, that is, my breasts and buttocks are big enough that any man's penis gets stuck in front of me. My distant relative's brother-in-law Sudeep is crazy about fucking me. He often comes to our house, and he squirms to touch me. I also want to push my breasts, legs or buttocks on him, then he screams and takes a deep breath when he sees me. I noticed that his penis becomes quite hard and he tries to hold it with his hand.

One day Sudeep was sitting in our house talking. I was sitting next to him, and I was pressing one of his hands on my lap. Suddenly the electricity went off and the room became dark. I was wearing a bra at that time. Sudeep took advantage of the darkness and grabbed my breasts from above the blouse and the next moment he put his hand inside the blouse and started pressing my breasts. I felt very good pressing my breasts, because my groom's sex had decreased a lot and our sex had almost stopped. Pressing Sudeep's breasts made my lust rise again. My groom wanted to put the candle in the fridge, but so that Sudeep could press my breasts properly, I forbade my groom to light the light. I also squeezed his erect penis from above Sudeep's pants. After about half an hour, the electricity came, by then Sudeep took advantage of the darkness and pressed my breasts continuously, making them red. That's when I decided in my mind, this penis, I will insert it into my pussy one day.

I requested Sudeep to come the next day at noon because my groom was in the office at that time. He came right on time the next day at noon. I was wearing only a thin nightie, through which my treasures were clearly visible. Sudeep's gaze was always on my breasts. I took his hand and brought him into the room and closed the door. Before I could say anything, Sudeep took off my nightie and made me naked and at one glance he started looking at my breasts and pussy. I also forcibly removed his shirt, pants, and panties. Sudeep's six-inch long penis was fully erect and was shaking.

More news, old woman, it became a fist ‚Äì 3
I immediately bent down and started sucking his penis. Sudeep held my head from behind and inserted his thick penis as far as possible into my mouth. I enjoyed licking the tip of his penis. His penis was throbbing as the juice from his penis was coming out. I sucked his penis continuously and drank all the juice. After a while, Sudeep made me stand up, took one of my nipples in his mouth and started sucking them like a child, and with one hand, he started pressing one of my breasts. The electricity of youth was flowing through my body. My nipples swelled and became like small palms.

Sudeep made me sit on the bed, spread my legs and started licking my pussy. I held his face between my breasts and put my legs on his back. My thick hair was entering his nose and mouth, so he could not lick my pussy properly. Sudeep asked me for a pair of scissors and a comb, then he started trimming my hair very patiently. He was trimming my hair very carefully so that my soft petals would not get cut by the scissors. I was having a lot of fun. I was kicking and shaking Sudeep's hard cock with my toes, which he liked very much.

After cutting Sudeep's hair, he wrapped it in paper and kept it with him so that when he went home and smelled my pussy, he could smell it. After cutting my hair, my pussy had become very attractive. Now the oval pink hole looked very beautiful. After Sudeep stared at my pussy for a while, he put his tongue in the hole again and started licking it. My juices were coming out and my pussy was shaking. I couldn't stay any longer. I pushed Sudeep on the bed and sat on him, and I held his cock in my pussy and pushed it hard. His whole cock entered my pussy. I screamed in pleasure. I started jumping hard on his stomach. Sudeep lifted his ass in the right rhythm with me and started thrusting into my pussy from below. After fifteen minutes of hard work, we both experienced extreme pleasure together, Sudeep poured a flood of semen into my pussy. I fucked a stranger for the first time in my life. Sudeep cleaned my pussy very carefully.

After resting for a while, Sudeep's cock got hard again. He spread my legs to fuck me again and climbed on top of me and put the tip of his cock in my ass and thrust it in one thrust. My pussy had been pounding for fucking for a while now, so in one thrust the whole cock entered my pussy again. This time I was enduring Sudeep's full pressure. His cock must have reached the end of my pussy. Ouch! Sudeep was thrusting so hard, it felt like a piston was going up and down in a cylinder. Sudeep thrusted again for ten minutes and cummed. I also made his cock wet with sexual juices, then we washed each other's genitals.

From then on, Sudeep often came to my house and fucked me. One day he wanted to take us to Digha for a trip. I agreed but on one condition, I would stay in a separate room with Sudeep there. My groom agreed after being forced. I asked Sudeep to buy a ticket for a two-seater bus so that I could sit next to Sudeep the whole way. When the bus reached a vacant spot, I moved the hem of my saree a little. Sudeep looked at my breasts with his eyes filled with tears, as if to say, come on, girl, let me fuck you naked today and make your vagina open. I placed one of his hands on my breasts. Sudeep started pressing my breasts vigorously. There was no way to go any further, We have to wait to enter this hotel.
After entering the hotel room, we closed the door and entered the field with renewed vigor. While I was undressing, I leaned forward to pick up my bra and panties from the ground, when Sudeep jumped on me from behind and started pounding my pussy with his cock. Then he extended his hand along the side of my body and started pressing my breasts with both hands, and increased the pressure and speed of his pounding. My soft ass was repeatedly bumping into his hard cock. That day, we fucked so much that I didn't want to go to eat rice at noon. Finally, my husband brought us our food. I sat on Sudeep's lap and ate rice. During the days we spent in Digha, Sudeep kept me naked all the time while we were in our house. After coming to the sea, Sudeep would wipe my pussy well with a wet cloth so that it wouldn't get scratched while inserting his penis.

Sudeep fucked me for about three years, after that, due to his transfer to another place, we didn't have regular sex, but weekly or fortnightly sex.
