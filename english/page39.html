Aunty fucking story ‚Äì My young cock in my mature pussy

Aunty Choda Story ‚Äì The Story of Fucking Aunty‚Äôs Mature Pussy with My Young Cock
My uncle‚Äôs house is in Ranchi. We went to uncle‚Äôs house on the occasion of Sage uncle‚Äôs wedding. My uncles are five brothers and three sisters. Sage uncle‚Äôs wedding. We went to uncle‚Äôs house four days before the wedding. My other relatives have arrived. The house is full of people. I am a student of class eleven. Due to my low physical growth, I still feel like a student of class nine. Some of my cousins ‚Äã‚Äãare in inter, some are in degree. And the rest are in primary. There is no one my age. I have no one to talk to or chat with. Still, I am spending time with everyone. It feels good. At night, I went to sleep with my brothers. They did not take me with them. Later, my mother made me sleep with my middle aunt.

My middle aunt‚Äôs house has been taken over by other relatives. She is sleeping in a store-type tin-wood room next to the kitchen. On the floor of which there are piles of raw vegetables. Rice sacks etc. There is no mosquito net on any bed. Because all the relatives have left, the mosquito net is short. Two mosquito coils are burning on both corners of the bed. My aunt, her one-year-old twin daughters and I lay down on the bed on the floor. I can't sleep because of the smoke from the coils. I couldn't sleep at night. After a couple of hours, I felt a little drowsy. At that moment, I heard a knock on the window near our head. The drowsiness passed. I lay down with my ears erect. After a while, there were two more tuk tuk sounds. Aunt called me, I pretended to be asleep and lay there. Another tuk tuk. Aunt called me again, I pretended to be unconscious in a deep sleep.
Aunt opened the window slowly, as if she was talking to someone in a whisper,
-Skip it today.
-Auntie, I'm going to die.

I understood the younger uncle's voice. My younger uncle failed the inter-university exam and resigned from his studies. He wasted a lot of money in the name of going to Europe and is now sitting as a vagabond. Aunty said slowly,
-Sumon is in my room
-When did he come back again.
-Don't tell me anymore, you're a scoundrel. Didi gave it to me, I couldn't say no. Leave it today.
-I can't, Aunty, please, it will take five minutes.
-The house is full of people. If anyone sees it, it will be ruined.
-I won't see anyone, and don't talk too much, open the door.
My older uncle leaned over me and tested my sleep. I passed the sleep test. He slowly got up and opened the back door with a wrench. My older uncle is in Malaysia. He comes to the country every two years. He leaves again after two months. After ten years of their marriage, these two children were born. Uncle has been abroad for about two years. I understood that my aunt's well was full even in my uncle's absence. My aunt sat her brother-in-law on the bed. The tapping had begun. My aunt pushed her two daughters next to me and made some space for them to lie down. In the dim light, I could clearly see the movements of two people of unequal ages. My aunt whispered
-The tapping hurts slowly
-Baudi, open your blouse.
-You don't need to open it today. When the relatives leave, do it as you wish.
There was no more sound in the room. The two of them were kissing in a slow, steady manner. My penis was erect. I needed to masturbate, but I couldn't. If I moved, I would be caught. My younger aunt climbed on my aunt. It started chop chop thap thap and stopped after five or seven minutes.
-What, Finis?

-Huh
-I couldn't put out my fire.
-Sorry, aunty, I was feeling tense, so I couldn't hold on to the goods.
-Have you satisfied your craving?
-I'm satisfied, but you're not, I'll satisfy it tomorrow.
-Not during the ceremony. When the people of the house come, satisfy it. Go now.
After taking uncle out through the back door, aunty silently lay down. My head is spinning. I'm thinking about how to make aunty happy. I'm very scared. If he complains to aunty, I'm finished. I heard aunty lightly snoring. I poured water from the water jug ‚Äã‚Äãon the table next to me and soaked my and Ruma Jhuma's bed. As soon as they woke up, aunty turned on the light. I also sat up. I rubbed my eyes and told aunty that they had made a mess on my bed. aunty saw that the bed was really wet. aunty wiped the bed thoroughly. After changing their bed, she put Ruma Jhuma aside and slept in the children's place.
-Suman, you're in trouble.
-No, Mami, it's not a problem. You're in so much trouble.
-What's wrong with me?
-You can't sleep properly for them.
-All mothers have to do this. You're not having any trouble sleeping, are you?
-Not like that.

Mami didn't talk any more. So I took a breath and said,
-Mami, will there be any lap pillows in the house?
-Why, what will you do with a lap pillow?
-I can't sleep without a lap pillow.
I was thinking that he would tell me to hug you and sleep. He didn't say that. He said,
-You're married, adjust yourself a little and sleep.
I pretended to be asleep and stayed in bed. After a while, Mami fell asleep. There was a sound of heavy breathing. I put one of my hands on Mami's chest. Mami's breathing stopped. I remained silent. After a while, I put one of my feet on Mami's thighs. Her breathing stopped again. I remained stubborn. After ten minutes, I touched one of Mami's breasts with my hand. There was no response. I slowly started squeezing Mami's breasts. There was no response. My courage grew. I placed one of my hands on Mami's thighs. Mami woke up,
-What are you doing, Suman?
I kept quiet. She moved my hands and feet away from her, and said in a threatening tone,
-Sleep properly or I will tell Didi everything in the morning.

-What am I doing?
-Why did you touch my chest? Do you think I don't understand anything.
-If you tell Mom, I will also tell everything.
-Mami was shocked after eating my thread,
-What will you say?
-What did you and Johnny Mama do.
-What did we do again?
-I saw everything.
-Where, what did you see?

Mami is stuttering. Mami's voice has become soft. She is really scared. There is no place to show Mami's face It won't be if I tell everyone about Mami's achievements tomorrow. I decided in my heart that I will have to use this opportunity.
‚Äì You sleep, I won't tell anyone.
-Give me too then.
-What will you give?
-Like Mami.
-My goal is, you are not young, young people don't have to do that.
-I am not young, I am in class eleven.
-Okay, you hug me now and sleep. When you are a little older, I will give you. Now sleep, Dad.
I hugged Mami. I am expressing milk, Mami is saying no no. I am not stopping. I am having fun. Now Mami is not stopping me anymore. I cannot press it properly over the blouse. I tried to unhook the blouse. Mami stopped me. I ignored her restraint and unhooked the hook. Mami was helpless. She was not wearing a bra. I started kneading Mami's two open breasts with flour.
-Ah Suman, slowly. It hurts.

Mummy woke up. I removed the clothes from Mumi's legs and put my hand in her pussy. Thinking that there would be no use in stopping her, Mumi gave herself up to fate. I climbed on top of Mumi and took off my pants. I wanted to insert my cock but I couldn't. Because in the dark, I couldn't set the cock along the gap in her pussy. Seeing my stupidity, Mumi laughed. Mumi put my cock in her pussy with her hand. With a push, I inserted my young cock into Mumi's ripe pussy. Mumi woke up with a aaaaahhhhhhh. I started pounding hard with all my might. I had fucked my maid before. So I'm not at all clumsy, when it was time for my money to come out. I stopped pounding and took out my cock. Mumi was moaning with pleasure from the fuck. I put my cock in again and pounded hard again. Mami hugged me. I felt like she was going to put me inside her body. I kept pounding. Pounding pounding pounding pounding pounding After ten minutes, Mami loosened her handcuffs. I understood that her goods were out. I pounded mine out ten more times and lay on her.
Mami whispered,
-What's the matter?
-Hmm. Shall I take yours?
-Hmm, it's over. Now sleep quietly.
-Mami, will you give it to me again tomorrow?
-We'll see about tomorrow.
Mami made Ruma lie down in the middle of the bed and went to the other side to sleep. I stayed at the wedding house for a week and fucked Mami for four nights. A year later, my younger uncle left for Italy. My older uncle would occasionally call me and would come to our house. And I would take my aunt to heaven by fucking her, taking advantage of the opportunity. Now I am 26. My aunt will be 38/40. My uncle has returned to the country. Yet our relationship is still unbroken.
